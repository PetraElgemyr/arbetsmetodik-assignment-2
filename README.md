## Description

The goal with this assignment is to practice code refactoring. I use an old project for this assignment and convert it to typescript (if it is in javascript) and refactor at least 3 parts, but aspire to refactor the entire code. Both the logic if needed, structure and styling.

### Commit messages

- (fix) - Used when something is wrong and needs to change logic if the functionality isn't right or there is a bug. Vanilla javascript is not to be used in this assignment so I also use fix-commits when I change javascript into typescript to fix old javascript bugs and errors. Fix is also used when I change bad names for variables and scss selectors.
- (feat) - Used when something new is added, some new function or when I add a new selector to the styling etc.
- (docs) - Commits related to the README file or basic overall comments as documentation to understand each function.
  I don't use optional scopes because the project is very small and only have simple functions with no api request in the project, or any other outside connections. The project is about creating html for 2 lists. There is no need to divide the commits any further.
